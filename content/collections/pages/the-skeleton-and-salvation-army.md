      On April 3rd 1884 a Captain Ada Smith was appointed as the new officer in charge of the Worthing Salvation Army.

      The first hall used by the army, known as the “barracks”, was down a narrow brick alley about eight yards long in an upper story of an old warehouse in Prospect Place. Half way up the alley was a side door of a liquor shop.

The drunken gangs of skeletons who harried Captain Ada’s little band of twenty through the streets, lobbing egg shells charged with blue paint, met with the towns folk full approval.'

      Until further notice Captain Ada Smith and her band were confined to barracks. General Booth wanted written assurance that the West Sussex County Constabulary would keep a fatherly eye on them. But the Chief Constable sat securely on the fence, he would treat both sides with impartiality.

      Booth was now beside himself and wrote a blistering memo to the Home Office saying that “Worthing magistrates simply refused to summon rif-raf molesting the Salvation Army.” the Home Secretary Sir Willam Harcourt stood by the letter of the law and had no power over local authorities.
