      Worthing is a seaside town in West Sussex, England, at the foot of the South Downs, west of Brighton, and east of Chichester.

      Starting life as a humble fishing hamlet until Princess Amelia, youngest daughter of George III, visited it in 1798. Writers Oscar Wilde and Harold Pinter lived and worked in the town. 

      The area around Worthing has been populated for at least 6,000 years and contains Britain's greatest concentration of Stone Age flint mines, which are some of the earliest mines in Europe. The Iron Age hill fort of Cissbury Ring is one of Britain's largest.
